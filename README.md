### Hi there :D

My name is Bruno Albino from Brazil (🇧🇷). I've been working as Developer since 2019 and currently I'm FullStack Developer at [Workgroup](http://www.workmotor.com.br).
I start programming back in 2014 and since then I've learn so much, making little open source projects (look on my repositories!)

In my free time, I do many things, some of them are:
- Play video games; 
- Watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺);
- Read books (📚); 
- Listen to music (🎵);
- Play Guitar (:guitar:)
- Play musics as DJ (:song:);
- And eventually I drink beers (🍺).
